A
witness
Aron
Kohn
who
said
he
was
in
the
rabbi
home
at
the
time
recalled
that
the
rabbi
was
near
the
Hanukkah
candles
when
the
intruder
stormed
in
I
was
praying
for
my
life
Mr
Kohn
said
He
started
attacking
people
right
away
as
soon
as
he
came
in
the
door
We
didnt
have
time
to
react
at
all
We
saw
him
pull
a
knife
out
of
a
case
Mr
Kohn
said
It
was
about
the
size
of
a
broomstick
Mr
Kohn
said
that
after
the
attacker
fled
he
tried
to
enter
a
synagogue
next
door
Congregation
Netzach
Yisroel
which
is
led
by
Rabbi
Rottenberg
But
people
inside
the
synagogue
apparently
heard
screams
from
the
rabbi
home
and
fearful
locked
the
door
so
the
attacker
could
not
get
in
Mr
Kohn
said
